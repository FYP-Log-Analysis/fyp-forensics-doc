# Preprocessing

**What's in this folder:**
- `event_filter.py` - Filters out unimportant log events
- `window_aggregation.py` - Groups logs by time periods

**Purpose:** This code cleans up the Windows logs before analysis. It removes logs we don't need and groups related events together by time, making the data easier to work with.
