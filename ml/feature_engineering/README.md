**What's in this folder:**
- `feature_extraction.py` - Pulls out important information from Windows logs

**Purpose:** This code takes raw Windows log data and extracts the important parts that we need for analysis. It's like taking a messy pile of information and organizing it into neat categories that our security analysis tools can understand.
