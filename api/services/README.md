# Services

**What's in this folder:**
- `__init__.py` - Makes this folder a Python package
- `logs_service.py` - Business logic for handling log data
- `pipeline_service.py` - Business logic for running the analysis pipeline

**Purpose:** This folder contains the "brain" of the API - the code that actually does the work when someone calls the web endpoints. It's separate from the routes to keep the code organized.
