# Routes

**What's in this folder:**
- `__init__.py` - Makes this folder a Python package
- `logs.py` - Web endpoints for accessing log data
- `pipeline.py` - Web endpoints for running the analysis pipeline

**Purpose:** This folder contains the web endpoints (URLs) that other programs can call to get data or trigger actions. Think of these as the "menu" of things you can ask the server to do.
